## Reflection Question

The difference between a nested if from an if-else is that a nested if is an if statement within another if statement, Which is used whenever you need to check multiple conditions hierarchically. Meanwhile, an if-else is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false. Also, it is mainly used for binary decisions (one or the other). The advantages of a switch over multiple if statements are readability, efficiency, and simplicity. For instance, it would be easier on the eye to read a single variable being compared to multiple constants. As having to read an abundance of if-else statements. Conditional operators simplify decision-making since it is a simpler, easier, and shortened version of an if-else statement. Short-circuit evaluation is a behavior in which the second argument is evaluated only if the first argument does not meet the result. For instance, in a && (AND) if the first argument evaluates to false then the second argument would not become evaluated and also become false. The same goes for the || (OR) if the first argument evaluates to true then the second argument would not evaluate and become true as well.
